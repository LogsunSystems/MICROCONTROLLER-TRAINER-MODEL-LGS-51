# MICROCONTROLLER-TRAINER-MODEL-LGS-51
## User manual of microcontroller trainer model LGS-51.
## Introduction.
the LGS51 series Trainer is designed to be both useful and instructive in illustrating certain concepts commonly encountered in 8051/52-based development. Although many kits already exist, this kit is designed specifically to form the basis of thorough technical discussions and tutorials consistent with Experts in the field of Microcontroller development & Experience Faculties in Microcontroller Subject.
The Kit is was developed with the 8031/51 in mind but can be used with any 40-pin 8052 pin-compatible derivative including the traditional true-blue 8052, 8051, 8032, 8031, 89C55WD, 89VRD2 etc.
It has
* 16X2 LCD Display
* 32K BB RAM,8+16K additional RAM, 32 k Monitoe EEPROM.Memory expandable up to 128 K.
* 48I/O lINES from 8255 X 2 nos. of serial ports from 8051 and 8251, on board 8253. 14 I/O lines from 8051 CPU which is very useful for students to interface other devices directly to microcontroller like DAC, stepper motor, DC motor etc.
*  built in Line assembler & disassembler.
*  with the use of PS2 Type keyboard user can directly write/enter the program in assembly language.
*  Can checked the entered code in mnemonics using disassembler facility.
*  To develop the skills in applications using 8051 we have wide range of interfacing modules to select like ADC, DAC, stepper motor etc.
